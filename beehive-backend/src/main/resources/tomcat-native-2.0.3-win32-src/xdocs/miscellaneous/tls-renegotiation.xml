<section name="Introduction">
  <p>
  Historically there have been security issues associated with TLS
  renegotiation. This page describes the renegotiation behaviour of the Tomcat
  Native library.
  </p>
</section>
<section name="Client initiated renegotiation">
  <p>
  Client initiated renegotiation is disabled. This behaviour is hard-coded and
  cannot be changed.
  </p>
</section>
<section name="Unsafe legacy negotiation">
  <p>
  Support for unsafe legacy negotiation depends on OpenSSL. Unsafe legacy
  renegotiation is disabled by default and will not be allowed unless the
  OpenSSL configuration option
  <code>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</code> is set.
